### Component Design Principles
Each component follows Polylith's principle of being "small, reusable bricks, that ideally does one thing only", with each brick being "a Python namespace package", enabling:

- **Code Reusability**: Components can be shared across different projects
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on components in isolation
- **Simple Testing**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Flexible Deployment**: Different combinations of components for different deployment scenarios, where "a project is the result of combining one base (or in rare cases several bases) with multiple components and libraries"

## Conclusion

This comprehensive plan provides a structured approach to building sejm-whiz using the Polylith architecture from initial research through production deployment on a single-node k3s cluster with local GPU inference. The Polylith architecture enables building "simple, maintainable, testable, and scalable backend systems" using composable building blocks, perfectly suited for this AI-driven legal prediction system.

The embedding-centric architecture leverages PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search capabilities, while the GTX 1060 GPU enables efficient local model inference. The Polylith workspace structure with reusable components ensures code maintainability and enables rapid development through REPL-driven workflows. The plan focuses on semantic understanding of Polish legal text through embeddings, enabling sophisticated similarity matching and prediction capabilities while maintaining cost-effective local deployment without horizontal scaling requirements.

The modular component design allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of different system parts, while the monorepo structure ensures code sharing and consistency across the entire application.
