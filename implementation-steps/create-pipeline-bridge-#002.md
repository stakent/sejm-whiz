IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF #002
Priority: High
Category: Backend/Integration

Business Requirement:

- Connect CLI interface to existing data processing pipeline components
- Enable orchestrated execution of document ingestion workflows through command-line interface
- Provide real-time progress reporting and error handling for batch processing operations

Technical Scope:

- Create CliPipelineOrchestrator class to bridge CLI commands with existing pipeline implementations
- Integrate enhanced_data_processor.py comprehensive pipeline with CLI interface
- Implement progress reporting using Rich console for real-time feedback
- Add error handling and graceful failure recovery for CLI operations
- Connect existing DocumentIngestionPipeline, database operations, and API clients
- Support multiple data sources (Sejm API, ELI API) with unified interface

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] CliPipelineOrchestrator class successfully imports and initializes
- [ ] CLI command `uv run python sejm-whiz-cli.py ingest documents --since 7d` executes without ImportError
- [ ] Pipeline processes documents from both APIs based on source parameter (eli, sejm, both)
- [ ] Real-time progress reporting displays document processing status
- [ ] Error conditions are caught and reported with meaningful messages to CLI
- [ ] Final statistics (processed, stored, skipped, failed counts) are displayed
- [ ] Duration tracking and performance metrics are included in output
- [ ] Database connections and operations work correctly through CLI invocation
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable during batch processing operations

Constraints:

- Timeline: 30-60 minutes for core functionality
- Dependencies: enhanced_data_processor.py, DocumentIngestionPipeline, database operations, CLI commands structure
- Non-functional requirements: Must handle long-running operations gracefully, provide meaningful progress feedback, manage
  database connections properly

Context: CLI command structure is implemented but references missing pipeline_bridge module. Multiple excellent pipeline
implementations exist (enhanced_data_processor.py with comprehensive multi-source ingestion, DocumentIngestionPipeline with ELI
integration, data_processor project with detailed pipeline steps). Need to create orchestrator that leverages these existing
components and provides unified interface for CLI execution with proper progress reporting and error handling.
