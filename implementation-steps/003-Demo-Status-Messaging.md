# IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF #003

Priority: Medium
Category: UI

## Requirement:

- Improve demo status messaging to show success instead of confusing "0 processed, 34 skipped" output

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] ELI ingestion shows "34 already exist" instead of "34 skipped, 0 processed"
- [ ] Demo output includes total document count from database
- [ ] Success indicators clearly show when pipeline is working correctly
- [ ] Progress reporting distinguishes between "new documents" vs "existing documents"
- [ ] Demo script shows embedding count alongside document count
- [ ] Clear success message when documents already exist in database

## Technical Constraints:

- Timeline: 1 hour
- Dependencies: Existing ingestion pipeline and CLI progress reporting
- Performance requirements: No impact on processing performance
- Compatibility requirements: Must work across all deployment environments

## Scope Boundaries:

- Do NOT change actual ingestion logic or database operations
- Do NOT modify error handling behavior
- Do NOT alter pipeline statistics calculation
- Focus only on improving user-facing messages and status reporting
