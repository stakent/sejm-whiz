IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF #003
  Priority: High
  Category: Backend/Integration/Documentation

  Business Requirement:
  - Enable complete end-to-end document processing pipeline demonstration
  - Provide functional CLI interface for document ingestion and search operations
  - Create comprehensive demonstration package for system capabilities showcase
  - Establish working proof-of-concept for AI-driven legal document analysis workflow

  Technical Scope:
  - Create CliPipelineOrchestrator class to bridge CLI commands with existing pipeline components
  - Implement pipeline_bridge.py module connecting enhanced_data_processor.py to CLI interface
  - Integrate real-time progress reporting using Rich console for user feedback
  - Create automated demo setup script with database initialization and sample data ingestion
  - Add basic architecture documentation with usage examples and system overview
  - Implement error handling and graceful failure recovery for production-like reliability
  - Connect existing DocumentIngestionPipeline, database operations, and API clients through unified interface

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] CLI command `uv run python sejm-whiz-cli.py ingest documents --since 7d --limit 10` executes successfully end-to-end
  - [ ] Pipeline processes documents from both Sejm and ELI APIs with real-time progress display
  - [ ] Documents are successfully stored in PostgreSQL with vector embeddings in pgvector
  - [ ] Search functionality works: `uv run python sejm-whiz-cli.py search query "ustawa"` returns relevant results
  - [ ] Database migrations execute successfully: `uv run python sejm-whiz-cli.py db migrate`
  - [ ] Demo setup script completes without errors and produces verifiable results
  - [ ] Basic documentation includes architecture overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
  - [ ] System handles API rate limits and network errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
  - [ ] Final statistics display correctly (processed, stored, skipped, failed document counts)
  - [ ] All components integrate without ImportError or configuration conflicts

  Constraints:
  - Timeline: 2 hours total (30min bridge + 45min testing + 45min documentation)
  - Dependencies: enhanced_data_processor.py, DocumentIngestionPipeline, database models, API clients, CLI framework
  - Non-functional requirements: Must handle long-running operations, provide real-time feedback, maintain data consistency, 
  demonstrate production-ready error handling

  Context: Project has excellent foundational architecture with Polylith components, comprehensive database schema, multiple API 
  integrations, and production-ready infrastructure. CLI interface structure exists but lacks connection to existing pipeline 
  implementations. Multiple pipeline implementations are available (enhanced_data_processor.py, DocumentIngestionPipeline, 
  data_processor project) requiring unified orchestration layer. Goal is to create working demonstration that showcases complete AI
   engineering pipeline from API ingestion through text processing to vector database storage and semantic search capabilities.
