‚óè IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF #001
Priority: High
Category: Backend/CLI Integration

Business Requirement:

- Enable functional document ingestion pipeline through CLI interface
- Provide working demonstration of API-to-database data processing workflow
- Support batch processing of legal documents with proper error handling

Technical Scope:

- Connect existing pipeline implementations to CLI command interface
- Implement document ingestion command with date filtering and source selection
- Integrate enhanced_data_processor.py functionality with CLI commands
- Add proper error handling and progress reporting for CLI operations
- Ensure database operations work correctly with CLI invocation

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] CLI command `uv run python sejm-whiz-cli.py ingest documents --since 7d` executes successfully
- [ ] Pipeline processes documents from both Sejm and ELI APIs based on --source parameter
- [ ] Date filtering works correctly with --since, --from, --to parameters
- [ ] Documents are successfully stored in PostgreSQL with embeddings in pgvector
- [ ] CLI displays progress information and final statistics (documents processed, stored, failed)
- [ ] Error conditions are handled gracefully with meaningful error messages
- [ ] CLI command respects --limit parameter for controlled batch sizes
- [ ] Integration works with existing database schema and migrations

Constraints:

- Timeline: 2-3 hours for core functionality
- Dependencies: Existing pipeline components (enhanced_data_processor.py, document_ingestion/, CLI framework)
- Non-functional requirements: Must handle API rate limits, provide progress feedback, maintain data consistency

Context: Multiple pipeline implementations exist (enhanced_data_processor.py, projects/data_processor/main.py,
document_ingestion/) but CLI commands currently show "not implemented" stubs. The goal is to create a single working entry point
that leverages existing well-architected components to demonstrate the complete data processing workflow from external APIs
through text processing to vector database storage.
